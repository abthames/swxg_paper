            The 2018 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report stated that nearly 6 billion peoples will suffer from clean water scarcity by 2050. This is the result of increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water, driven by dramatic population and economic growth. It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inter-linkage in between population and economic growth and water demand, resources and pollution, that ultimately drive water scarcity, and the relevance of these aspects in local, rather than global, perspective, with a view to stimulating debate.},

	abstract = {This study provides an overview on the impacts of climate change on agricultural water management, including agricultural water requirement, water availability and water quality, and the transition of those impacts to crop yield, agricultural land suitability and livestock production systems, considering both long‐term trends of climate and extreme climatic events. A synthesis of findings from local, regional, and global studies guides this article's discussion of scientifically based information, implications for managing the risk of water scarcity and food insecurity, and future research. Negative and positive climate change impacts occurring at the local scale may counteract each other at the global scale (e.g., those on irrigation requirement and arable land availability); the impacts from the various factors can be counter‐balanced too (e.g.,
              
                CO
                2
              
              and water deficit impact on crop yield). Meanwhile, the shocks at the local and regional levels have been or will be caused by water quantity and quality problems and are pressing concerns for decision making. Although uncertainty in climate change predictions remains a critical issue for decision making, certain knowledge about the impact on crop production has been obtained from historical data. Finally, future research needs to focus on gaining a more detailed understanding of climate change (especially extreme events), climate change impacts, both natural and social response mechanisms, and adaptation measures of agricultural water management. More focus should be laid on improving impact assessment via the various methods such as retrospective analysis, monitoring, prediction, and strategic risk management. Moreover, planned adaptations in agricultural water management will be needed to facilitate more consistent and more effective responses to climate change, with consideration of the linkage with nonagricultural water uses.

	abstract = {The rapid growth of demand in agricultural production has created water scarcity issues worldwide. Simultaneously, climate change scenarios have projected that more frequent and severe droughts are likely to occur. Adaptive water resources management has been suggested as one strategy to better coordinate surface water and groundwater resources (i.e., conjunctive water use) to address droughts. In this study, we enhanced an aggregated water resource management tool that represents integrated agriculture, water, energy, and social systems. We applied this tool to the Yakima River Basin (YRB) in Washington State, USA. We selected four indicators of system resilience and sustainability to evaluate four adaptation methods associated with adoption behaviors in alleviating drought impacts on agriculture under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios. We analyzed the characteristics of four adaptation methods, including greenhouses, crop planting time, irrigation technology, and managed aquifer recharge as well as alternating supply and demand dynamics to overcome drought impact. The results show that climate conditions with severe and consecutive droughts require more financial and natural resources to achieve well-implemented adaptation strategies. For long-term impact analysis, managed aquifer recharge appeared to be a cost-effective and easy-to-adopt option, whereas water entitlements are likely to get exhausted during multiple consecutive drought events. Greenhouses and water-efficient technologies are more effective in improving irrigation reliability under RCP 8.5 when widely adopted. However, implementing all adaptation methods together is the only way to alleviate most of the drought impacts projected in the future. The water resources management tool helps stakeholders and researchers gain insights in the roles of modern inventions in agricultural water cycle dynamics in the context of interactive multi-sector systems.},

In Part 1 of this series, we present the details of model development and validation. The model is based on the identification and simulation of weather regimes, or large-scale patterns of atmospheric flow, which are then used to condition the simulation of local, daily weather at a 6 km resolution across the state. We conduct a thorough validation of a baseline, 1000-year model simulation to evaluate its ability to accurately simulate daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature at various spatial scales (grid cell, river basin) and temporal scales (daily, event-based, monthly, annual, inter-annual to decadal). Results show that the model effectively reproduces a large suite of climate statistics at these scales across the entire state, including moments, spells, dry and wet extremes, and extreme hot and cold periods. Moreover, the model successfully maintains spatial correlations and inter-variable relationships, enabling the use of model simulations in hydrologic and water resources analyses that span multiple watersheds across California. The weather generator can simulate physically plausible extreme events (e.g., multi-day extreme precipitation and severe drought) that extend beyond the worst case conditions observed historically, independent of climate change. Thus, the baseline simulation can be used to understand the impacts of natural climate variability on both flood and drought risk in regional water systems.

	abstract = {Global climate model (GCM) output typically needs to be bias corrected before it can be used for climate change impact studies. Three existing bias correction methods, and a new one developed here, are applied to daily maximum temperature and precipitation from 21 GCMs to investigate how different methods alter the climate change signal of the GCM. The quantile mapping (QM) and cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) bias correction methods can significantly alter the GCM’s mean climate change signal, with differences of up to 2°C and 30\% points for monthly mean temperature and precipitation, respectively. Equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm) bias correction preserves GCM changes in mean daily maximum temperature but not precipitation. An extension to EDCDFm termed PresRat is introduced, which generally preserves the GCM changes in mean precipitation. Another problem is that GCMs can have difficulty simulating variance as a function of frequency. To address this, a frequency-dependent bias correction method is introduced that is twice as effective as standard bias correction in reducing errors in the models’ simulation of variance as a function of frequency, and it does so without making any locations worse, unlike standard bias correction. Last, a preconditioning technique is introduced that improves the simulation of the annual cycle while still allowing the bias correction to take account of an entire season’s values at once.},

The GCMs were downscaled using deep learning, random forest, and nine quantile mapping bias correction methods for 22 gauge stations in South Korea. Data from the Korean Meteorology Administration (1970–2005) were used as the reference data in this study. Two statistical measures, the standard deviation and interquartile range, were used to quantify the uncertainties. The probability distribution density was used to assess the similarity/variation in rainfall distributions. For the historical period, the uncertainty in the selection of bias correction methods was greater than that in the selection of GCMs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the projection period. The projection period had the lowest level of uncertainty in the selection of RCP scenarios, and for the future, the uncertainly related to the time period was slightly lower than that for the other sources but was much greater than that for the RCP selection. In addition, it was clear that the level of uncertainty of inland areas is much lower than that of coastal areas. The uncertainty in the selection of the GCMs was slightly greater than that in the selection of the bias correction method. Therefore, the uncertainty in the selection of coastal areas was intermediate between the selection of bias correction methods and GCMs. This paper contributes to an improved understanding of the uncertainties in climate change projections arising from various sources.},

Most notably, policy challenges such as abrupt climate change involve potential nonlinear or threshold responses where both the triggering level and subsequent system response are poorly understood. This study uses a simple computer simulation model to compare several alternative frameworks for decision making under uncertainty—optimal expected utility, the precautionary principle, and three different approaches to robust decision making—for addressing the challenge of adding pollution to a lake without triggering unwanted and potentially irreversible eutrophication. The three robust decision approaches—trading some optimal performance for less sensitivity to assumptions, satisficing over a wide range of futures, and keeping options open—are found to identify similar strategies as the most robust choice. This study also suggests that these robust decision approaches offer a quantitative, decision analytic framework that captures the spirit of the precautionary principle while addressing some of its shortcomings. Finally, this study finds that robust strategies may be preferable to optimum strategies when the uncertainty is sufficiently deep and the set of alternative policy options is sufficiently rich.},

            Water resources systems models enable valuable inferences on consequential system stressors by representing both the geophysical processes determining the movement of water and the human elements distributing it to its various competing uses. This study contributes a diagnostic evaluation framework that pairs exploratory modeling with global sensitivity analysis to enhance our ability to make inferences on water scarcity vulnerabilities in institutionally complex river basins. Diagnostic evaluation of models representing institutionally complex river basins with many stakeholders poses significant challenges. First, it needs to exploit a large and diverse suite of simulations to capture important human‐natural system interactions as well as institutionally aware behavioral mechanisms. Second, it needs to have performance metrics that are consequential and draw on decision‐relevant model outputs that adequately capture the multisector concerns that emerge from diverse basin stakeholders. We demonstrate the proposed model diagnostic framework by evaluating how potential interactions between changing hydrologic conditions and human demands influence the frequencies and durations of water shortages of varying magnitudes experienced by hundreds of users in a subbasin of the Colorado River. We show that the dominant factors shaping these effects vary both across users and, for an individual user, across percentiles of shortage magnitude. These differences hold even for users sharing diversion locations, demand levels or water right seniority.

            The Upper Basin of the Colorado River in the southwestern United States supports municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational activities worth an estimated \$300 billion/year within the state of Colorado alone. The allocation of water to these activities is fundamentally shaped by water rights that in turn distribute risks among a diverse suite of sectors and stakeholders. In this study, we assess the vulnerabilities faced by the hierarchy of hundreds of water users in the portion of the Upper Basin within the state of Colorado, as a result of changes in hydrologic extremes, demand growth, and institutional and physical infrastructure in the basin. We also determine how robust the different users are to these potential changes, examining how their sensitivity to these factors depends on the magnitude and frequency of shortage they are unwilling to exceed. This advances previous robustness evaluation methods by formalizing an a posteriori exploration of alternative definitions of robustness tailored to each user's unique context. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies significantly not only across users but also across different definitions of acceptable performance for each user. We further show the importance of using scenario discovery to evaluate how the factors that drive consequential scenarios differ depending on the definition of robustness. Our results highlight the need for robustness and vulnerability frameworks to avoid broad categorical aggregations of stakeholder groups, to carefully capture complex institutional dependencies (e.g., water rights), and to facilitate a more transparent illustration of the implications of alternative definitions of robustness for specific stakeholders.

            Planning under deep uncertainty, when probabilistic characterizations of the future are unknown, is a major challenge in water resources management. Many planning frameworks advocate for “scenario‐neutral” analyses in which alternative policies are evaluated over plausible future scenarios with no assessment of their likelihoods. Instead, these frameworks use sensitivity analysis to discover which uncertain factors have the greatest influence on performance. This knowledge can be used to design monitoring programs and adaptive policies that respond to changes in the critical uncertainties. However, scenario‐neutral analyses make implicit assumptions about the range and independence of the uncertain factors that may not be consistent with the coupled human‐hydrologic processes influencing the system. These assumptions could influence which factors are found to be most important and which policies are most robust, belying their neutrality; assuming uniformity and independence could have decision‐relevant implications. This study illustrates these implications using a multistakeholder planning problem within the Colorado River Basin, where hundreds of rights holders vie for the river's limited water under the law of prior appropriation. Variance‐based sensitivity analyses are performed to assess users' vulnerabilities to changing hydrologic conditions using four experimental designs: (1) scenario‐neutral samples of hydrologic factors, centered on recent historical conditions, (2) scenarios informed by climate projections, (3) scenarios informed by paleohydrologic reconstructions, and (4) scenario‐neutral samples of hydrologic factors spanning all previous experimental designs. Differences in sensitivities and user robustness rankings across the experiments illustrate the challenges of inferring the most consequential drivers of vulnerabilities to design effective monitoring programs and robust management policies.

            Plain Language Summary
            How we should best manage our water resources depends on future water supply and demand, both of which are changing in uncertain ways as a consequence of climate change, population growth, and sectoral change. This makes it challenging to decide between alternative management plans that may be most favorable under different conditions. Given this uncertainty, many planning frameworks advocate for implementing “robust” management plans that perform reasonably well over a wide range of conditions. These plans can then be modified adaptively to cater to particular climate and socioeconomic conditions as our uncertainty about the future is reduced. Unfortunately, we find that the determination of which plan is most robust, and what conditions should trigger adaptation, is an additional challenge. In assessing the vulnerabilities of hundreds of water users in the Upper Colorado River Basin to different possible drought conditions, we find different users to be robust depending on which scenarios are considered. The sensitivities of these users' water shortages to different climate conditions also depend on which scenarios are considered. Since we do not know which scenarios are most plausible, we recommend that climate vulnerability assessments consider multiple sets of scenarios when evaluating alternative water management plans and designing monitoring programs.

The evaluations are often undertaken using deterministic mathematical models that require daily weather data as input. Stochastic generation of the required weather data offers an attractive alternative to the use of observed weather records. This paper presents an approach that may be used to generate long samples of daily precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and solar radiation. Precipitation is generated independently of the other variables by using a Markov chain‐exponential model. The other three variables are generated by using a multivariate model with the means and standard deviations of the variables conditioned on the wet or dry status of the day as determined by the precipitation model. Daily weather samples that are generated with this approach preserve the seasonal and statistical characteristics of each variable and the interrelations among the four variables that exist in the observed data.

Most of the conventional WGs are single-site models, which neglect the spatial dependence in the simulated meteorological field, are improper for regional impact studies. In recent several decades, efforts have been devoted to develop multivariate, multisite weather generators (MMWGs), which are able to reproduce the inter-variable and inter-site dependencies as well as the temporal structures observed in the historical records. Though several improvements have been achieved, the existed MMWGs are either conceptually complex or computationally expensive, and have difficulty in preserving the entire desired attributes. This study proposes a new two-stage scheme for constructing a MMWG. At the first stage, the meteorological series are simulated from a single-site multivariate weather generator (SMWG), which preserves the marginal distributional attributes for each meteorological variable. For the second stage, the inter-variable and inter-site dependencies as well as the temporal structures are reproduced using the Empirical Copula (EC) approach. An application of the proposed MMWG is presented for the Upper Thames River Catchment, Canada, and the performance is evaluated and compared with another two-stage MMWG based on the Iman shuffle approach. Results show that the proposed MMWG not only preserves the marginal distributional attributes, but also restores the inter-variable and inter-site dependencies, the temporal persistence, and the inter-annual variability almost perfectly. The performance of the proposed MMWG outperforms the one based on the Iman shuffle approach in terms of reconstruction of temporal persistence and inter-annual variability, as well as the reproduction of multivariate dependencies. Being conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, the proposed scheme based on the EC approach is well suited for developing ensemble-based climate scenarios for vulnerability assessment and impact studies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

“In most of the parametric WGs, precipitation is often treated as the primary variable, and other meteorological variables are modeled conditioned on the occurrence and nonoccurence of precipitation. For example, in the most famous Richardson-type WGs (Richardson 1981; Richardson and Wright 1984), other meteorological variables are simulated by a first-order vector (i.e. multiple variables modeled simultaneously) autoregression conditioned on the wet and dry status of daily precipitation. However, this conditioning is weakly defined, which may have limitations in representing the complex, nonlinear inter-variable dependence structure, such as the nonlinear relationship between precipitation and temperature. Nonparametric methods such as K-nearest-neighbor simulator (Lall and Sharma 1996; Rajagopalan and Lall 1999) could in some extent capture the nonlinearity of inter-variable dependence, however, they have drawbacks in simulating extreme values outside the range of historical observations, since the resampling is dependent wholly on historical observation.”

            The state of Colorado's West Slope Basins are critical headwaters of the Colorado River and play a vital role in supporting Colorado's local economy and natural environment. However, balancing the multi‐sectoral water demands in the West Slope Basins while maintaining crucial downstream deliveries to Lake Powell is an increasing challenge for water managers. Internal variability of the hydroclimatic system and climate change complicate future vulnerability assessments. This work contributes a detailed accounting of multi‐sectoral drought vulnerability in the West Slope Basins and the impacts of drought on downstream deliveries. We first introduce a novel multi‐site Hidden Markov Model (HMM)‐based synthetic streamflow generator to create an ensemble of streamflows for all West Slope basins that better characterizes the region's drought extremes. We capture the effects of climate change by perturbing the HMM to generate an ensemble of streamflows reflecting plausible changes in climate. We then route both ensembles through StateMod, Colorado's water allocation model, to evaluate spatially compounding drought impacts across the West Slope Basins. Our results illustrate how drought events emerging from the system's stationary internal variability in the absence of climate change can significantly impact local water uses and deliveries to Lake Powell, exceeding extreme conditions in the historical record. Further, we find that even modest climate change can cause a regime shift where historically low downstream delivery volumes and extreme drought impacts become routine. These results can inform future Colorado River planning efforts, and our methodology can be expanded to other snow‐dominated regions that face persistent droughts.

            Plain Language Summary
            The state of Colorado's West Slope Basins ‐ six watersheds within the Colorado River Basin on the western side of the continental divide ‐ are essential water sources for the Colorado River and play a vital role in supporting the state of Colorado's local economy and natural environment. Water managers in the region are challenged by competing water demands for uses such as agriculture, environmental flows, and downstream deliveries to Lake Powell, a critical regional reservoir. Evaluating drought vulnerability in the region is complicated by the inherent randomness of streamflows and reduced flows from climate change. This work contributes a new analysis of local drought vulnerability in the West Slope Basins and the consequences for water deliveries to Lake Powell. We introduce a method to generate streamflow scenarios and explore drought impacts in the West Slope Basins. We run the scenarios through a model of the human‐natural system to explore local and regional drought vulnerability. Our results reveal elevated drought risks to downstream water users, agriculture, and the environment, even without climate change. Further, we find that even optimistic climate change projections can exacerbate drought risk, leading to unprecedented challenges for local water users and the broader regional system.

Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global, but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions. Adaptation is most relevant as an influence on decisions which exist irrespective of climate change, but which have consequences on decadal time-scales. Even in such situations, climate change is often only a minor influence; perhaps helping to restrict the choice of ‘no regrets’ strategies. Nevertheless, if climate models are to provide inputs to societal decisions, it is important to interpret them appropriately. We take climate ensembles exploring model uncertainty as potentially providing a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty and thus a non-discountable climate change envelope. An analysis pathway is presented, describing how this information may provide an input to decisions, sometimes via a number of other analysis procedures and thus a cascade of uncertainty. An initial screening is seen as a valuable component of this process, potentially avoiding unnecessary effort while guiding decision makers through issues of confidence and robustness in climate modelling information. Our focus is the usage of decadal to centennial time-scale climate change simulations as inputs to decision making, but we acknowledge that robust adaptation to the variability of present day climate encourages the development of less vulnerable systems as well as building critical experience in how to respond to climatic uncertainty.},

	abstract = {An analytic scenario generation framework is developed based on the idea that the same climate outcome can result from very different socioeconomic and policy drivers. The framework builds on the Scenario Matrix Framework's abstraction of “challenges to mitigation” and “challenges to adaptation” to facilitate the flexible discovery of diverse and consequential scenarios. We combine visual and statistical techniques for interrogating a large factorial data set of 33,750 scenarios generated using the Global Change Assessment Model. We demonstrate how the analytic framework can aid in identifying which scenario assumptions are most tied to user‐specified measures for policy relevant outcomes of interest, specifically for our example high or low mitigation costs. We show that the current approach for selecting reference scenarios can miss policy relevant scenario narratives that often emerge as hybrids of optimistic and pessimistic scenario assumptions. We also show that the same scenario assumption can be associated with both high and low mitigation costs depending on the climate outcome of interest and the mitigation policy context. In the illustrative example, we show how agricultural productivity, population growth, and economic growth are most predictive of the level of mitigation costs. Formulating policy relevant scenarios of deeply and broadly uncertain futures benefits from large ensemble‐based exploration of quantitative measures of consequences. To this end, we have contributed a large database of climate change futures that can support “bottom‐up” scenario generation techniques that capture a broader array of consequences than those that emerge from limited sampling of a few reference scenarios.
